    title : What is NoteBlockChain?
    content : NoteBlockchain is a fun and easy way to get started with cryptocurrency. It is aimed at everyone from complete beginners to advanced enthusiasts. Your coins can be stored in an easy to access (and recover) mobile wallet without having to remember complex private keys or mnemonic phrases. Compared to other cryptocurrency projects, NoteBC is organized like a regular software development project and was launched with a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) comprising of working mobile and web wallets and a coin explorer. Focus on User Experience is key and we will never lose sight of that.

    title : Where do I store my Notes (NTBC)?
    content : The easiest way to store Notes is through the Mobile wallet apps available for both iOS and Android devices. Download links are available at [Notebc.com > Wallets](https://www.notebc.com/walletsandapps). In order to make it easy to store and recover your Notes, your wallet account is tied to a phone number (which is used by us to send a verification code). The private keys for your wallet is stored securely on our servers. You can reinstall the app, move between phones (and get the upgrade you finally wanted) without losing your balance.

    title : How do I give someone Notes?
    content : It is easy to give Notes aka NTBC. Our favorite way is to use the mobile app where you can print Notes and share the image with family and friends. It is not necessary for the receiver to have a wallet or a NoteBC address. If they already have the mobile app, you can scan their wallet address from your mobile phone. You can also send NTBC through the web wallet or the desktop wallets.
